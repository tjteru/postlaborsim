# Post-Labor Economy Simulation

An interactive web-based simulation exploring potential economic outcomes as AI and robotics transform the workforce. This tool models various scenarios for the transition to a post-labor economy, incorporating real economic data and projections.

## üöÄ Features

### Interactive Scenarios
- **Gradual Adaptation**: Slow, managed transition with retraining programs
- **Rapid Displacement**: Fast automation with limited adaptation
- **Post-Scarcity Abundance**: Technology creates material abundance for all
- **Concentrated Ownership**: Wealth concentrates among tech/capital owners
- **Universal Basic Income**: Government provides basic income for displaced workers

### Dynamic Visualizations
- **Sector Automation Risk**: Interactive bar chart showing automation risk by industry
- **Wealth Distribution**: Real-time doughnut chart based on Gini coefficient calculations
- **Employment Timeline**: 20-year projection of employment rates with AGI timeline integration
- **GDP vs Unemployment**: Time-dimensional scatter plot showing economic trajectories
- **Wealth Inequality Trends**: Multi-scenario comparison over time with asymptotic modeling

### Configurable Parameters
- **Automation Speed**: Rate of technological adoption
- **Government Response**: Level of policy intervention
- **Technology Distribution**: Concentration vs democratization of tech ownership
- **Retraining Investment**: Resources allocated to workforce development
- **AGI Timeline**: When Artificial General Intelligence is achieved (2026-2040)

## üìä Economic Modeling

### 2025 Economic Baselines
The simulation is anchored to verified 2025 economic data:
- **Global GDP Growth**: 3.1% (OECD)
- **Labor Share**: 69.9% (Tax Foundation)
- **Global Unemployment**: 4.9% (WEF)
- **U.S. Gini Coefficient**: 0.485 (World Population Review)
- **Manufacturing Automation**: 31% baseline penetration

### Key Algorithms

#### Wealth Distribution Formula
```
ŒîGini = 0.01 √ó (Automated GDP / Total GDP)^1.5
```

#### Automation Penetration (Logistic Growth)
```
f(t) = baseline / (1 + e^(-0.2(t - t‚ÇÄ)))
```

#### Pre/Post-AGI Logic
- **Before AGI**: All scenarios follow similar baseline trajectories
- **After AGI**: Scenarios diverge based on policy responses and parameter settings

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with accessible components
- **CSS3**: Modern design system with CSS custom properties
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, no external dependencies except Chart.js

### Data Visualization
- **Chart.js**: Dynamic, responsive charts with real-time updates
- **Custom Calculations**: Economic modeling with parameter sensitivity
- **Time-Dimensional Analysis**: Multi-year projections with AGI timeline integration

### Key Files
- `index.html`: Main application structure
- `app.js`: Core simulation logic and chart implementations
- `style.css`: Responsive design system
- `CLAUDE.md`: Development documentation for AI assistants

## üìà Economic Indicators

### Real-Time Metrics
- **GDP Growth Rate**: Annual economic expansion
- **Unemployment Rate**: Workforce displacement tracking
- **Wealth Inequality**: Gini coefficient (0=equal, 1=unequal)
- **Jobs Displaced**: Automation impact on employment
- **New Jobs Created**: Emerging opportunities
- **Productivity Growth**: Economic efficiency gains

### Outcome Assessments
- **Social Stability Index**: Composite measure of societal resilience
- **Economic Prosperity Score**: Overall economic health
- **Innovation Index**: Technological advancement rate
- **Quality of Life Rating**: Holistic well-being measure

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
